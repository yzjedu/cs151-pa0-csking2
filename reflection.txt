It was very nice to be able to solve a problem for my dad even though it was a very simple equation
that can be done by hand, because it let me practice my coding abilities. It was a lot more difficult to figure
out the github mechanics by myself, but now that I have done it by myself it is now a lot easier
to navigate through the site. I would come in for office hours next time and discuss with you about what I am doing
because I found myself lost at times and a simple fix could have been done instead of taking me a long time to figure
out. Overall, this was a good first experience in coding by myself and now I am a lot more capable with
my abilities.
